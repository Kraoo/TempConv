## Description

This is my first Rust project by myself. I have been following the Rust book [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) for a bit now and decided to take a stop from it and try something myself. It is similar to the guessing game with just a little extra to it. Used `std::io` for user input, `loop` for the Menu and then takes the users input. Now here I used if else statements because it felt the most simple approach, I am aware of match but I don't know what advantages it would provide so I just stuck with if else. And that's my first Rust project, boring, simple, and very small but for the limited time I have put in I am happy with it for a first.
